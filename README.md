## Introduction

The "Major Power Outage Risks in the U.S." dataset comes from the Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure at Purdue University.

This dataset has information about every major power outage in the United States between January 2000 and July 2016. There are 55 variables containing information that might explain how these power outages happened and how they were fixed. This dataset obtained its information from (i) OE-417 form Schedule 1 published by DOE×³s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability; (ii) U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) [form EIA-826 and EIA-861]; (iii) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); (iv) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC); (v) U.S. Department of Labor; Bureau of Labor Statistics; and, (vi) U.S. Census Bureau [1]. 

This dataset contains 1534 observations and 56 features. The features include the time and date of power outage occurrences, location, duration, causes of the events, electricity consumption, and regional and economic characteristics.

It's important to understand why power outages are happening, so we'd be better prepared for them. There are many questions that we may strive to answer: With the increase of climate change, has there been more severe weather over the years? Are electricity companies keeping up and updating the protection of their facilities from severe weather? Are there more power outages now than in the past (climate change) (grouped 2000-2008 and 2009-2016)? Is there an upward trend? By ratio, are there more power outages now due to severe weather compared to the past?

For our analysis, we will answer aim to analyze the following hypothesis:

*Null hypothesis*: The ratio of power outages due to severe weather from 2000-2008 is the same as the ratio of power outages overall.

*Alternative hypothesis*: The ratio of power outages due to severe weather from 2000-2008 is less than the ratio of power outages overall.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

We deleted rows and a column that didn't have data. Then we converted the excel file into a csv.

The MONTH column was changed from floats to ints since they're all whole numbers. For both MONTHS and CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED, we filled NaN values with 0. We could assume that if CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED was so insignificant that it wasn't recorded, then there probably wasn't anyone affected.

For the purposes of our hypothesis test, we converted the CAUSE.CATEGORY column into binary "severe weather" and "other" for any other cause. The YEARS column was converted to a binary year_range column to specify if the power outage occured in the first half or second half of our data time range. We don't have any missing data in either of these categories.
